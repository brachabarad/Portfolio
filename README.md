# A sample of data analytics projects I worked on while studying and searching for a job

1) Python Project - RFM analysis

This is my final project for Coding for Data (Part 2) at the Global Tech Experience.
In this course I learned how to use Python for data analysis,
Subjects included while and for loops, creating functions, slicing and flitering, libraries (Pandas, Plotly Express, Numpy), 
dictioneries, data frames and arrays, aggregations & joins.
The final project utilized all of these to preform an analysis of Frequancy, Recency and Monetary criteria on sales data, including recommendations for the marketing team.
