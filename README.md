# A sample of data analytics projects I worked on while studying and searching for a job

1)	Python Project - RFM analysis (Colab Notebook)

This is my final project for “Coding for Data” (Part 2) at the Global Tech Experience.
In this course I learned how to use Python for data analysis, using Jupiter Notebooks.
Subjects included while and for loops, creating functions, slicing and flitering, libraries (Pandas, Plotly Express, Numpy), dictioneries, data frames and arrays, aggregations & joins.

The final project utilized all of these to preform an analysis of Frequancy, Recency and Monetary criteria on sales data, including recommendations for the marketing team.


2)	SQL Project - User Behavior (13 pages, PDF)

This is my final project for “Coding for Data” (Part 1) at the Global Tech Experience.
In this course I learned how to use SQL to wrangle and analyze data.
Subjects included sorting, filtering and grouping data, debugging errors, manipulating data with functions and aggregations, joins and unions, exploring data and creating subqueries.

The final project utilized all of these to clean and analyze data set of users of a bike sharing service and the changes in user behavior after the service was transferred to a different company. 
I performed a union on the two data sets, created new columns, cleaned the data, and prepared it for analysis. Then I created Tableau visualizations and offered analytics and recommendations based on them.


3)	Tableau Project – KPI Analysis (Tableau workbook with CSV datasets, JPG screenshots)

This is my final project for “Intro to Data Analytics” (Part 1) at the Global Tech Experience.
In this course I learned how to use Tableau to prepare, clean. visualize and analyze data.
Subjects included creating calculated fields, cleaning data using calculated fields, creating and formatting charts and chart elements, creating filters and parameters, joining datasets and creating dashboards.

The final project utilized all of these to create KPIs for the management of a hospitality startup, and offered analysis of the data as well as dashboards they can investigate on their own.
I performed a union on the “properties” and “property_calendars” datasets, prepared and cleaned the data, created charts for each of the KPIs as well as two dashboards presenting the overall data to the executive managers and the area relevant data for the regional managers. I also analyzed the data for the managers, offered suggestions for actions based on the analysis, and requested additional data that can add to the understanding of the organization’s performance.
