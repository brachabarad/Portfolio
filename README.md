# A sample of data analytics projects I worked on while studying and searching for a job

1) Python Project - RFM analysis (Colab Notebook)

This is my final project for Coding for Data (Part 2) at the Global Tech Experience.
In this course I learned how to use Python for data analysis,
Subjects included while and for loops, creating functions, slicing and flitering, libraries (Pandas, Plotly Express, Numpy), 
dictioneries, data frames and arrays, aggregations & joins.
The final project utilized all of these to preform an analysis of Frequancy, Recency and Monetary criteria on sales data, including recommendations for the marketing team.

2)	SQL Project - User Behavior (13 pages, PDF)

This is my final project for Coding for Data (Part 1) at the Global Tech Experience.
In this course I learned how to use SQL to wrangle and analyze data,
Subjects included sorting, filtering and grouping data, debugging errors, manipulating data with functions and aggregations, joins and unions, exploring data and creating subqueries.
The final project utilized all of these to clean and analyze data set of users of a bike sharing service and the changes in user behavior after the service was transferred to a different company. 
I performed a union on the two data sets, created new columns, cleaned the data, and prepared it for analysis. Then I created Tableau visualizations and offered analytics and recommendations based on them.
